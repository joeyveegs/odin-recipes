        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I absolutely love Meera Sodha's Fresh India cookbook. My mum has been cooking
            meals from this book for years now, and it's the only book we really go back to
            time and time again. I thought it'd be nice to add a recipe that I haven't tried
            before. I saw this the other day and thought it looked delicious.

            As someone who's always been a huge fan of Korma and any other creamy curries,
            this one looks like it's right up my street. It looks really different from
            anything else we've made from the book, so I'm excited to give it a go!
