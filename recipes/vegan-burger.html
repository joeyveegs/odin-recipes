        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I went down to stay with my sister for a few days about a year ago, and saw that she had Matt Pritchard's cookbook Dirty Vegan. I decided to make the dirty vegan burger from the cookbook for everyone, but the kitchen was an absolute <strong>bombsite</strong> once I was finished. My sister's anger at the mess I'd made was so worth it for the taste of these beautiful burgers!
        </p>
        <p>
            I thought it'd be nice to add a recipe from a proper Welshie like Matt. My favourite Welsh cook is actually Gaz Oakley, who does a traditional Welsh cawl that I haven't made yet. But anyway, this little vegan recipe page wouldn't be right without a proper burger!
