        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a recipe that I found back in 2015 and only cooked a couple of times,
            so it's been almost a decade since I last tried it!
            It's an African recipe that's full of good vegan protein.
            It's actually probaby one of the only African dishes I've ever attempted to make.

            Zoe explains in her book Zoe's Ghana Kitchen that the dish gets its name from being
            coloured twice - once from the red of the palm oil and again from the tomatoes.
            I'll be using rapeseed oil for convenience.
            I don't know much at all about Ghanian culture, but it's nice to know
            they have such a tasty vegan dish as a staple!
