        <p>
            I went down to stay with my sister for a few days about a year ago, and saw that
            she had Matt Pritchard's cookbook Dirty Vegan. I decided to make the dirty vegan
            burger from the cookbook for everyone, but the kitchen was an absolute bombsite
            once I was finished. My sister's anger at me was so worth the taste of these
            beautiful burgers, though!

            I thought it'd be nice to add a recipe from a proper Welshie like Matt. My favourite
            Welsh cook is actually Gaz Oakley, who does a traditional Welsh cawl that I haven't made
            yet. But anyway, this little vegan recipe page wouldn't be right without a proper burger!
